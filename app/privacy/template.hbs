<p>This privacy statement is applicable to the CKDU.ca website. By using this site, you agree to the terms and conditions below.</p>
<p>CKDU.ca respects the privacy of its Internet users and will protect that privacy as vigorously as possible.</p>
<p>CKDU.ca does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. In all such cases, CKDU.ca will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to CKDU.ca to gain access to any feature of CKDU.ca will not be sold or made available to a third party. The only exception for disclosing user information is when required by law or when user is suspected of illegally interfering with our systems, files and copyrights. Adhering to the latest laws, CKDU.ca does not want or keep personal information of readers under thirteen years of age.</p>
<p>CKDU.ca reserves the right, however, to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest in and use of the various sections of its sites so as to improve design and navigation and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>As well, users should be aware that certain non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by CKDU.ca through the operation of what are called "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. CKDU.ca uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-CKDU.ca usage.</p>
<p>If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer by CKDU.ca, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your Netscape or Internet Explorer browser. Note that it is possible that some aspects of CKDU.ca may be unavailable to you if you choose this option.</p>
<p>If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed of their appearance, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section.</p>
<p>Users should be aware that when you are on CKDU.ca, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from the CKDU.ca pages that take you outside our service.</p>
<p>For example, if you "click" on a related links site, the "click" takes you off our site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use CKDU.ca logo as part of a co-operative or co-branding agreement.</p>
<p>These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. CKDU.ca's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond CKDU.ca's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.</p>
<p>When you send us e-mail, we will use your name and e-mail address only to respond to the concerns you write to us with. Your e-mail may be shared with appropriate people within CKDU.ca to help us respond to your concerns and improve our online services. If you choose to e-mail a letter to the editor for publication, or submit a question to our advice column, we may run your message and name in our site. We will not publish your e-mail address unless given explicit permission.</p>
<p>CKDU.ca is posted online without warranties of any kind, either express nor implied. Continuing to access CKDU.ca is confirmation that you agree to indemnify CKDU.ca and its affiliates particularly protecting us from any liabilites, claims, or expenses for any damages that may result from your use of this site. This includes direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages and attorney's fees arising from your access to, or use of, CKDU.ca, including, but not limited to, challenges for infringement, libel and slander.</p>
<p>From time to time, CKDU.ca may introduce new products and services to its users and members. CKDU.ca reserves the right to modify this policy at any time by notifying customers, via CKDU.ca, of a new privacy policy.
